# Stability Training Experiments

In this folder, you can find most of the stability experiments we made:
+ `1_training`: How we trained our architectures
+ `2_gaussian_perturbations`: Experiments with samples perturbed with Gaussian Noise
+ `3_jpg_perturbations`: Experiments with samples perturbed by jpg compression
+ `4_fastisign_perturbations`: Experiments with samples perturbed by Fast Gradient Sign method
+ `5_automatic_experiments`: Experiments on different Stability training configuration, on Fast Gradient Sign perturbations.
+ `0_test_fastsign_computation` : Tests that our symbolic computation of Fast Sign Method is working
+ `0_test_mnist_network`: Tests that our `BaseNetwork` object haves the expected behavior
+ `0_test_stability_network`: Tests that our `tabilizedCifarNet` is working expectedly.
